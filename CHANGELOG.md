## Version 2.4 Changelog
# [ UNRELEASED ]

### New Features:
- **Screen Status Handler Enhancement:**
  - Added the ability to enable or disable the Screen Status Handler feature from the config file.
  - When set to '1', the script will automatically enable the profile when the screen is off and disable it when the screen is on.
  - When set to '0', the script is effectively paused, and no automatic actions will be taken.
  - This provides greater control and flexibility for users to manage the script's behavior.

- **Menu Options Customization:**
  - Every menu option in the script can now be configured to apply changes either immediately or after a device reboot.
  - Users can choose when to apply specific settings, giving them more control over their device's performance and power management.

#### Added
- Merged the following scripts into one `SUB_Daemon`:
  - `cpu_gov_lock_screen_handler`: Controls CPU governors based on screen lock status.
  - `cpu_freq_on_lock_handler`: Manages CPU frequencies when the screen is locked or unlocked.
  - `data_wifi_on_lock_handler`: Controls mobile data and Wi-Fi when the screen is locked or unlocked.
  - `screen_off_profile_handler`: Handles screen status and profiles.
  - `auto_sub`:
Handles Battery saver Profile depending on Screen State

#### Enhanced
- Improved script efficiency by combining multiple functionalities into a single loop.

#### Changed
- Improved screen status detection by checking display state instead of brightness.
  - This change addresses an issue where the script now accurately determines the screen's on/off state.
- Special thanks to [@fashl1](https://t.me/fashl1) for reporting the issue.

### Bug Fixes and Optimizations:
- Improved script performance and stability.
- Resolved minor issues reported by users.

Thank you for your continued support, and we hope you enjoy the enhanced features and flexibility in version 2.4!
