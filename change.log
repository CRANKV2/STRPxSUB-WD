### `v2.2` - Power Unleashed!
- Added battery management feature:
- The module now monitors the battery status in `Real-time`
- If the battery percentage falls below `20%` and the device is not charging, it will enable the Battery Profile to save power.
- If the battery is both under `20%` and charging, the module will disable the Battery Profile to ensure optimal charging.
- No action will be taken if the battery is above `20%` or the device is not charging.
------
- Added a menu feature `(FHA)` for freezing or force closing power-hungry apps with user-defined resource thresholds and app types.
- Users can now choose between freezing or force closing apps, specify a resource usage threshold, and select the type of apps (user, system, or both) to target.
- The processes are displayed as `PID` and their numbers before taking action on power-hungry apps.
------
- Added a feature to back up the current CPU governor settings when enabling the Ultra Battery Profile.
- Implemented a governor restoration mechanism to revert to the previous governor settings when turning off the profile.
- Enhanced governor selection logic to check for the availability of governors and use the most power-efficient one for improved battery backup.
- Introduced a fallback to a general governor when the device does not support the selected governors.
- Implemented comprehensive logging of all profile-related actions in the "Ultra Battery Profile Debug Log" located inside the main module path for improved debugging and user visibility.
- Enhanced DVFS management when enabling the profile, preventing dynamic changes to CPU frequencies and governors to maximize power efficiency during Ultra Battery mode.
- Changed Main Menu Layout for a better readability.
