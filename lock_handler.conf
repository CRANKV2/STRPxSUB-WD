# This config file part is used to control the behavior of the script that
# automatically turns off wi-fi and mobile data when the screen is turned off,
# and turns them back on when the screen is turned on.
# The script uses the following variables:


# set this variable to 1 to enable the script, set it to 0 to disable it.
mw_enabled=0


# set this variable to 1 to turn off wi-fi when the screen is turned off, 
# set it to 0 to keep wi-fi on even when the screen is turned off.
wifi=0


# set this variable to 1 to turn off mobile data when the screen is turned off, 
# set it to 0 to keep mobile data on even when the screen is turned off.
mobile_data=0


# When the script is enabled, it will continuously check the status of the screen and the 
# current status of wi-fi and mobile data, and turn them off or on if necessary.
# 
# The script checks the screen status using the debug.tracing.screen_brightness property, 
# and the status of wi-fi and mobile data using 'settings get global' command
#
# Note that this script is for android devices only, it is dependent on the internal properties 
# and settings of the device and might not work as expected on different android devices.
# Also make sure to check the permissions.
